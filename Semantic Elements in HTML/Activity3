                    <p>
                        The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic
                        dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The
                        dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.
                        Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
                        diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
                    shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
                    around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior
                    visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex. They perform many roles for humans,
                    such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting
                    police and the military.

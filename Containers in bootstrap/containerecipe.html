        <h1>Hobby 1</h1>
        <p>One of my hobbies is cricket. its a game that I am pretty passionate about. I started playing cricket since 7. Some rules in cricket are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two teams of 11 players compete on a field with a 22-yard pitch and a wicket at each end.</li>
            <li>The batting team takes turns with the fielding team, batting and bowling. The bowler bowls the ball to the striker, who
            tries to hit it away from the wicket.</li>
            <li>The batsmen try to score runs by crossing back and forth between the wickets. A run is scored each time both batsmen
            reach the opposite wicket. A ball hit over the boundary scores four points if it lands on the ground and six points if
            it's a fly ball.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just some of the rules in cricket and I'm barely scratching the surface! It's an exciting game that requires teamwork and excellent sportsmanship.</p>

        <h1>Hobby 2</h1>
        <p>I love reading fiction books since its somewhere I feel that anything is possible. It makes me immerse into the main character and helps me travel into a space in my own mind. Some of the popular book series (ranging from most popular to least popular) that I have read are:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Harry Potter</li>
           <li>The Lord of the Rings</li>
           <li>Percy Jackson</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are way more books out there but these are the 3 most popular books that I have read and enjoyed. These are a must read!</p>
